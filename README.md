# Laparoscopy Cholecystectomy, an Open Source Virtual Reality Project
This is an open source project for laparosocpy cholecystectomy simulation using virtual reality techniques. The prime purpose of thie project is to facilitate doctors in laparoscopy training and make it available to large number of population of doctors and surgeons. 

Laparoscopy is minimally invasive operation (MIO). It is performed at abdominal cavity and has many advantageous factors over open surgery like shorter healing time, early recovery of patient etc. Its training is very important and due to cost, hard to implement. In this text, we develop a virtual reality laparoscopic chocystectomy simulator for the training of young doctors. A purpose of the simulator is that, it should be able to train a doctor with least involvement of senior laparosurgeons. The simulator will be evaluated using subjective evaluation to find out whether it turns out to be a better training environment than animals or dead bodies.
